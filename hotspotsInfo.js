The kidney typically contains several triangular-shaped renal pyramids, and their base faces the outer region of the kidney, while the apex points inward, towards the renal pelvis. Renal pyramids are composed of nephron loops (loop of Henle) and collecting ducts, which play crucial roles in the process of urine formation.",
